To  Save the File: using .cpp extension

C++: The full name of the language is C++, which is pronounced "C plus plus". 
CPP: CPP is sometimes used as an abbreviation for "C Plus Plus". 

step 1: we need to call header file

#include <iostream>-header file in C++ is used for input and output (I/O) operations.

C++ uses a stream-based model for input and output, where data flows as a stream of bytes.

Advantages :

Type-Safe: Ensures proper data types during input and output.

Readable Syntax: Uses << for output and >> for input, making the code more intuitive.

No Format Specifiers: Unlike printf/scanf, you don't need to remember format specifiers like %d or %s.

Why Use using namespace std;?

Convenience:

It avoids the need to write std:: before standard library components like std::cout, std::cin, std::string, etc.
